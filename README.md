# Jamf Pro upload scripts and AutoPkg processors

These scripts and AutoPkg processors are designed to allow the upload of packages, categories, computer groups, scripts, extension attributes and policies to Jamf Pro, using the Jamf Pro API and Classic API.

The AutoPkg processors require no additional installation above AutoPkg itself.

The standalone scripts require a python 3 installation.
