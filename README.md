# jamf-upload

A set of scripts designed to allow easy interaction with the Jamf Pro APIs, in particular for the upload of packages, categories, computer groups, scripts, extension attributes and policies to Jamf Pro, but also for managing their deletion. 

The standalone scripts require a python 3 installation.

The uploader scripts have also been converted to AutoPkg processors. These are hosted in the [grahampugh-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes/tree/master/Jamf_Recipes) GitHub repo.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/grahampugh/jamf-upload/wiki) for instructions on using both the standalone scripts and AutoPkg processors.
